# Testing Documentation

## Code Validation

### HTML validation

I have completed a final validation of all HTML pages using the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/).\
I found two errors on the 'book.html' page:
 - The empty option element did not have a label for screen-readers.
 - There was a stray end tag for an anchor element on the page.

Both errors were easily rectified; all other pages showed no errors.

### Css Validation

I have completed a final validation of my 'style.css' file using the [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).\
No errors were found.

## User Story Validation

### Restauranteur User Stories

*"Grow online presence: The website must be highly compliant and SEO friendly..."*\
Site uses semantic elements throughout, contains appropriate meta elements, clean code and looks great on any device.

*"Drive home brand identity: The website must be consistent with the restaurant's branding..."*\
The site had a very strong and consistent Western theme throughout and showcases the venue and staff.

*"...Allow users quick access to information about what is on the menu"*\
The website's navigation is obvious and not hidden or cluttered, and the menu.html page contains clear and comprehensive menu information.

*"The website needs to be effective at turning customer interest into bookings and revenue"*\
The option to book is part of the menu structure, and thus this call to action appears througout.  The booking page contains all the infomration needed to plan a visit, prominently displayed.

*"Grow social presence: The website needs to provide access to the restaruant's social accounts so that the people can share and the business can grow. It would also be useful to link review sites such as Google, Tripadvisor and Trustpilot."*\
The footer on every page not only contains social links but also contains links to tripadvisor and google for peer review.

*"Create positive engagement... It should be a place which users enjoy visiting and wish to return to, just like the restaurant itself!"*\
The eyecatching logos and fun 'sheriff star' menu backgrounds along with the attractive fonts, eyecatching images and intuitive layout ought to result in people coming to visit the site even when they're not hungry!

### Customer User Stories

*"Mobile Functionality: ... They need the site to look just as good on their mobile devices whilst retaining full functionality."*\
The site was build mobile upwards, starting in all cases with a 360px screen width and then adjusting upwards to desktop screen sizes.  This is reflected in some of the design choices - for example to kepe the site clean there are no transitions or features that would not be functional on mobile.

*"Easy to Navigate... Links to various areas of the site should be obvious, responsive and consistent."*\
The navigation is clear and obvious on all device sizes, with additional immidiacy through having no additional widgets to open. The navigation is the core of the site.

*"What do they sell? users... want as much info as they can get online, as fast as they can get it. This includes the menu, which they want to be able to access and read quickly and in full."*\
The main homepage callout immediately details what the restaurant sells, its theme and where it is located.  Navigation is immediate and clear, with the Menu page the first option.

*"Clear branding: This userbase needs to know what is on offer, as well as getting a feel for the theme and style or the restaurant, from the very first page."*\
The homepage styling and callout text provides and immediate overview of the restaruant and what it sells, whilst clearly communicating the theme through styling and fonts. The big picture of a tasty burger gets home what they can expect to eat when they visit!

*"X-factor: The target audience wants, for want of a better word, cool stuff."*\
Although more limited in scope than I would like to implement various CSS effects because of the limitations of mobile, the unique menu visuals, entertaining fonts and eye-catching theming set this website apart from others.

*"Contact Information: As important as the menu, they want to know where this place is, how to get there, and how to book it."*\
This was a trade-off, and in the end a matter of balancing the need to drive bookings against providing more general information.  However the Homepage Callout makes clear where the restaurant is located, which means the call to action to book is on every page via the navigation.  The booking page contains full contact and booking information prominently displayed.

*"Peer review: As a social generation, it is very important what their cohorts think. Our users need validation to help their purchasing decisions, in the form of reviews and testimonials."*\
The Homepage provides immediate validation in the form of positive customer reviews, and the footer contains links to social and review platforms.

*"Venue Information: Very much on a theme, they want to see what the place looks like to make sure it's sufficiently Instagramable."*\
The about section contains appropriate images of the venue food as well as the staff to provide all the information people need.

### Manual Testing

I have chosen to manually test using 3 screen sizes:
 - 360px to represent a smaller screen sizes, for which I will use Chrome on Android (Samsung Galaxy S8)
 - 768px to represent larger phones or tables, for which I will use Chorme and Firefox in responsive mode via their respective developer tools.
 - 1200px to represent desktop screen sizes, for which I will use Chorme and Firefox in responsive mode via their respective developer tools.
